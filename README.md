# HACK_HERITAGE-AQUATECH

## PROJECT for HACK_HERITAGE &amp; contributions by team members

### 1> **Proposed Solution Overview:**

**Forecasting Groundwater Needs:** Utilizes predictive models with historical data and machine learning to forecast future water demands across irrigation, industrial, and domestic sectors.

**Extreme Weather Impact:** Analyzes the effects of extreme weather on water availability using climate models, ensuring climate resilience in water resource planning.

**Automated Graphical Reports:** Provides automated, user-friendly visualizations (charts, graphs) to assist officials in data analysis and decision-making.

**Water Needs Calculator:** A web-based tool that estimates water requirements using customized formulas for accurate resource management.

**Climate-Based Water Analysis:** Correlates climate data with water demand, enabling proactive planning and adaptation to long-term climate trends.

## **2> Problem Being Solved**

The project addresses the challenge of sustainable groundwater management by tackling the following key issues:

**Unpredictable Future Water Demands:** Difficulty in forecasting groundwater needs for various sectors (irrigation, industrial, domestic) due to changing population dynamics, industrial growth, and agricultural demands.

**Impact of Climate Change:** The increasing frequency of extreme weather events (droughts, floods) makes it challenging to predict and manage water resources effectively.

**Data Complexity:** Officials often struggle with analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of data to make informed decisions on water resource allocation.

**Resource Waste:** Inefficient estimation methods lead to overuse or underutilization of water, resulting in resource waste and potential shortages.

**Lack of Proactive Planning:** Current water management practices often fail to account for long-term climate trends and future needs, leading to reactive rather than proactive decision-making
